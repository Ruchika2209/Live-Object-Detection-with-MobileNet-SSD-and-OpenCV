# Live-Object-Detection-with-MobileNet-SSD-and-OpenCV Deep Learning
Introduction
Developed a real-time object detection system leveraging MobileNet SSD and OpenCV to detect and track multiple objects (e.g., person, car, dog) in live webcam streams. This project applies deep learning for practical computer vision workflows and visualization.

Tools Used
Python: Core programming language for scripting and integration.
OpenCV: For video capture, image preprocessing, and visualization.
MobileNet SSD (Caffe): Lightweight deep learning model for fast object detection.
NumPy: Efficient numerical operations for image and bounding box processing.

Objective
To build a fast, real-time object detection system capable of recognizing 20+ object classes using a webcam.
To understand and apply deep learning models within OpenCVâ€™s dnn module.
To gain practical experience in image preprocessing, model deployment, and visualization in real-time.

Conclusion
Successfully implemented real-time multi-object detection with high frame rates, displaying bounding boxes and confidence scores on live video feeds. This project strengthened practical skills in computer vision, deep learning deployment, and real-time system building, forming a solid foundation for advanced AI applications in surveillance, robotics, and autonomous systems.
